Programming Assignment Two

- Any path changes to the source images must be reflected in the makefile.
- By default, downloading and running the files in this folder should compile and run correctly.
- Execute: make clean
- For S1 results, execute: make s1
- For S2 results, execute: make s2
- To clean up the folder, execute: make clean
- To check if the program compiles, execute: make
- Result images are named the same as their source with "_Result" appended in the filename

- Special Note: For some strange reason, there is a bug that is not consistently reproducable which
will make the result images distorted and unlike that in the report. When this project was turned in,
the execution of the program did not result in thos distorted images, but it is a possibility that it
might occur on a different machine.
