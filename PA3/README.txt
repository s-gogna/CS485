Programming Assignment Three

Part One:
	- All Test images should be in a folder named "Test" and all filenames should be unchanged
	- $ make One
	- The results will be generated in the "Test" folder
Part Two:
	- Boat images should be in a folder named "Boat" and all filenames should be unchanged
	- Graf images should be in a folder named "Graf" and all filenames should be unchanged
	- $ make Two
	- The results will be generated in their respective folders
Manually Compiling and Running:
	- $ g++ PartOne.cpp -g -Wall -o One
	- $ g++ PartTwo.cpp -g -Wall -o Two
	- ./One [filename without extension]
	- ./Two [filename without extension]

Special Note:
- Part Two generates lots of images (between 17-18 for each step and 17 final Overlay images)
